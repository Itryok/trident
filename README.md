Design and implement an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle capable 
of real-time monitoring and data collection in underwater aquatic 
environments. The AUV should be able to measure water quality, detect 
garbage clusters, pollutants, marine life, and oil spills using 
on-board sensors and camera. The data collected should be transmitted 
to a remote station for analysis and decision-making. It should also 
incorporate a robust navigation and obstacle avoidance system, with a
 thrust of novelty towards either the vision vertical, the power 
vertical, communications, or affordability.
